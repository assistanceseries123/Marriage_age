    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <p>
        A computer is one of the best man-made creations 
        that has been developed to help the people in various 
        sectors. It has become such an important part of our
         lives that we find computers everywhere we go. 
         Starting from our school life till our old age,
          we have many uses for computers. We have been so 
          much dependent on computers that we are using computers 
          for almost everything we do. It is a device that can 
          store an enormous amount of data in it. We are so 
          much dependent on computers that we do not want to 
          put any pressure on ourselves. We blindly store all
           our data in a computer with a safety passcode. 
           A computer takes up the responsibility and 
           processes the output in no time, hence making 
           our life easier. It collects the data, processes 
           it and then provides the final result to us within
            a very short time. People in this day and age have
             become so reliant on computers that they cannot
              imagine life without them. Computers are significant
               because of their widespread use, productivity,
                and openness. Computers are the most needed innovation due to their incredible benefits. Computers are used in every field like the education sector, hospitals, hotels, etc. If you go for a CT Scan, X-ray, or an ECG, you will need a computer to check your body. In case you want to submit a project, you will need a computer.
         It has become a part of our lifestyle.
