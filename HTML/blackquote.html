        Education is the most potent means for social transformation and our universities 
        have to play the role of change-agents, said the President of India, Smt Droupadi Murmu. 
        She was speaking at the inaugural function of St. Joseph’s University in Bengaluru today
         (September 27, 2022)

The President said that it is the responsibility of educational institutions to train and 
equip the students in such a way that they are prepared for 
the demands of the future.
 The President said that today’s young people are aspirational. Our universities
  need to respond to their diverse aspirations.  For this, out-of-the-box thinking 
  is needed. Such thinking may lead to rich learning experiences and creative solutions.
    She said that the National Education Policy 2020 is one such effort to make the academics
     align with the changing needs. It also emphasizes critical thinking and innovation.
  According to this Policy, education is more about critical thinking and less about rote learning.
